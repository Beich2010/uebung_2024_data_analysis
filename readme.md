# Data Analysis Lecture 2024 - Exercise Notebook

Welcome to the exercise notebook for the Data Analysis Lecture of 2024. This repository contains all the materials and notebooks you will need to follow along with the course exercises.

## Opening the Notebook

There are three recommended ways to open and run the notebook:

### 1. Google Colab (Recommended)

Google Colab is a free, cloud-based Jupyter notebook environment that allows you to run Python code in your browser without any setup.

To open the notebook in Google Colab, follow these steps:
1. Click on the following link: <a target="_blank" href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/Beich2010/uebung_2024_data_analysis">

</a>
2. Select the notebook file (`excercise_2024_data_analysis.ipynb`) to Colab.
3. Start running the cells.

### 2. Binder

Binder provides a way to create sharable, interactive notebooks that run in the cloud. It requires minimal setup and is a good alternative to Google Colab.

To open the notebook in Binder, follow these steps:
1. Click on the following link: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Beich2010/uebung_2024_data_analysis/HEAD)
2. Launch the environment and open the notebook file (`excercise_2024_data_analysis.ipynb`).

### 3. Local Environment

If you prefer to run the notebook on your local machine, you will need to set up the environment manually.

To install and run the notebook locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Beich2010/uebung_2024_data_analysis.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the repository directory:
    ```bash
    cd your-repo-name
    ```
3. Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
    ```
4. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
5. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
6. Open the notebook file (`excercise_2024_data_analysis.ipynb`) and start running the cells.

## Notes

- Ensure that you have Python 3.10 or higher installed on your local machine.
- If you encounter any issues or have questions, please refer to the course resources or contact the course instructor.

Happy analyzing!
